<h2>progress on upgrading the site</h2>

<b>23 March 2020</b> - A reminder: the <a href="index_old.htm">original tabs page</a> and the <a href="app_index.htm">scrolling app</a> should<br>
work fine with Firefox. Many people prefer having all the tabs on one page,<br>
so that option will remain. But for those using other browsers or accessing the site<br>
using cell phones or tablets hopefully there will soon be a choice of other formats.<br>
A search box has been added to the home page using Google's 'sitesearch' feature.<br>
<br>

<h2>background</h2>

Praise for Classtab on Reddit varies from 'super low tech' to 'ugly as fuck'.<br>
The size of the main page was causing loading problems with some browsers,<br>
and it's not optimised for cell phones and tablets. A site upgrade looks inevitable.<br>
But first, I'd like to acknowledge the many generous offers of help received over<br>
the years, and give my excuses as to why most of them haven't been taken up.<br>
(Though the main reason is that I prefer tabbing to upgrading web sites.)<br>
<br>

<h2>miscellaneous thoughts on developing the site</h2>

some people prefer the current page style, so a simplified (downloadable) version could still be available<br>
<br>
<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">possible meta data:</td>
<td>LHF, RHF, key signature, tuning, time signature, tempo, tab date, difficulty level,<br>
tab author (name, email), style/era of music, tab history (corrections, updates),<br>
composition date, different versions of tab, solo/duo/trio/quartet etc</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
option for random choice of tab?<br>
<br>
different language versions?<br>
<br>
options for discussing tabs (wiki? forum?)?<br>
<br>
option for submitting new tabs and corrections online?<br>
<br>
separate app(s) for mobiles and tablets? server-side device detection?<br>
<br>

queries about a new site -<br>
- will it still work with older (legacy) and text-only browsers?<br>
- will it be machine-translatable and usable by non-English speakers? (eg using Google translate)<br>
- will it be easy to navigate by people with common types of colour blindness?<br>
- will it have a global edit facility? (eg for changing a tabber's email address in multiple tabs)<br>
- will it incorporate Google site verification?<br>
- how will the site integrate with the scrolling app?<br>
- is a search facility needed? (or maybe use Google site search?)<br>
- will it work ok with mobiles and tablets?<br>
- how easy will it be to move the site to a new web host if the designer is no longer involved?<br>
- will the site come top of search engine results for the query term "classical guitar tablature"?<br>
- will individual tabs be indexable directly by search engine robots? (most traffic comes via Google searches)<br>
- <b>but above all, will it be easy to maintain on an everyday basis?</b><br>
<br>
is a maximum of 80 characters a line for tabs still optimal? if not, what is?<br>
(do people still use fixed character width printers?)<br>
<br>
why are the tabs in ASCII plain text format?<br>
- small file size (not many bytes)<br>
- plain text will probably be in use long after other tab formats have disappeared<br>
- ASCII is an international non-proprietory standard and is readable by inbuilt commands on most operating systems<br>
- can be viewed by any text editor, browser or word processor that uses a standard European character set<br>
- isn't vulnerable to malware and viruses<br>
- easy to edit and customise<br>
- disadvantage: (strictly speaking) it only has standard characters (eg no accents)<br>
- disadvantage: it's difficult to generate a MIDI file from the tab (and vice versa)<br>
- disadvantage: it's difficult to generate a score from the tab (and vice versa)<br>
